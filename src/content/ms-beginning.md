excerpt: How it all started.

I'd like to go back in time before it started, The day is Sunday, <mark>June 29th 2014</mark>.
It was a sunny morning, I'm an 18 year old student going to school 8AM to attend an exam, The school isn't far away, just a 10 Min. ride from home.
I remember a strange feeling while getting into the public transport microbus, a <mark>slight pain deep inside my head</mark> lasting moments, I felt lost for a second and my head was hit in the bus door frame, My brain easily ignored that incident at the time, I was heading for a chemistry exam and <em>I gotta remember every formula!</em>

As I engage in the exam an hour later, I noticed that <mark>my hand writing</mark> is a bit different, It felt like taking more time than usual to write. Trying to ignore any thougts and concentrate, I told myself you must be a bit tired.

It seemed to me that fasting is affecting my performance, It was the 2nd day of Ramadan.
But I happen to love chemistry and did great in the exam that day, soon I was home having some rest after all!

After a day rest, I finally will finish my high school and the final exam is <u>Dynamics</u>: The easiest subject of them all, I even slept to the last hour that day and didn't review any problems. I got off the microbus to walk a few meters to school, I was walking with a friend on the pavement, and I remember he said I was <mark>walking with a tilt towards the road on my left</mark>, which was true! For some reason I didn't know, I tried to convince myself everything is fine, <i>it's the very last day and you're done</i>.

<strong>I'm now free!</strong> said to myself starting the long awaited vacation, that is playing video games 24/7, For 2 weeks I did nothing but play, until that day, Wednesday, <mark>July 16 2014</mark>,
At 5PM while walking between rooms at home, I suddenly feel the same momentarily pain I had 2 weeks ago, for a second <mark>I feel unpluged</mark> and fall to the floor.
I became much worried and started thinking of that feeling outside the context of Ramadan, next day I went with my mom to see the family doctor, he did some routine checks and eventually said "Everything appears normal, we should do a <mark>brain CT</mark> to make sure everything is fine".

On Friday July 18th, I had the first medical imaging in my life, a brain CT, that showed nothing abnormal! The radiologist suggested doing a <mark>brain MRI</mark>, that concluded with a demyelinating white matter disease, the radiologist said <em>I must see a neurologist ASAP</em>, I knew it was bad because I just googled "walking difficulty" the day before and found many results about the chronic CNS disease called <abbr title="Multiple Sclerosis">MS</abbr>.
